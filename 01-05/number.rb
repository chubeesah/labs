#Question 1: 'cowsay', 'uptime', and 'trace'
#'cowsay' was an entertaining picture of a cow that you can make say something via a thought or speech bubble. 'uptime' displays the amount of time spent on the particular terminal session from what I understood. 'trace's manual made me think I was reading an alien language.
#I did the command uptime, and it worked very well.
